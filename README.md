# "I am Here" 

Developed by Team Earthlings

“I am Here” is a secure platform connecting newcomers with volunteers. Using the application, volunteers can post their availabilities, manage schedules, and chat with newcomers. Newcomers can easily access the accommodation, translation, and transportation services provided by volunteers.
